# RFC Process — CMR

This directory contains Requests for Comments (RFCs) for the
Capability Message Runtime (CMR).

Each RFC documents a single, concrete design decision or experiment
that advances the system toward semantic closure.

RFCs are:
- narrowly scoped
- explicitly motivated
- technically verifiable
- historically permanent

They are not proposals for discussion,
but records of decisions that have been validated in code.

## Authorship

Tony (Dong Yuan)

Primary designer and author of the CMR architecture.

## Acknowledgement

This work benefited from extensive structured reasoning
and iterative clarification through AI-assisted dialogue.
