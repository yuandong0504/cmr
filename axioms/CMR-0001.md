# CMR-0001: Structural Execution Invariants

## Proven invariants (from automation failure analysis)

1. An execution step may only occur if all its declared predecessors have completed successfully.
   - Example: APPLY_CHANGE must not occur unless VALIDATION explicitly allows it.

2. Rollback is a declared phase, not an implicit side-effect.
   - It may only occur after RESULT_VERIFICATION.

3. Execution order is structural, not conventional.
   - If a transition is not declared as a step, it must not happen.

## Non-goals
- This document does not define how steps are executed.
- This document does not prescribe implementation details.

## Status
- Derived from real-world automation failure patterns.
- Treated as non-negotiable constraints.
